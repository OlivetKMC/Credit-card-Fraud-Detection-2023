# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This repository contains a credit card fraud detection project that utilizes logistic regression as the primary machine learning model. The project involves data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation. The dataset consists of various transaction attributes, and the logistic regression model aims to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.


## Model Training and Evaluation
The project includes the training and evaluation of a logistic regression model. Key steps include:

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Cleaning and wrangling the dataset for machine learning model compatibility.

2. Model Training:
   - Employing logistic regression to train the model on historical transaction data.

3. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluating the model's performance on a test set, including precision, recall, and AUC-ROC metrics.

4. Feature Importance:
   - Identifying the top feature importances that contribute to the model's decision-making.

## Usage
To run the project locally, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. 

Execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts in the repository to reproduce the analysis and model training. The notebook/script will guide you through the steps and provide insights into the credit card fraud detection process.

## Important Note
This project is meant for educational and illustrative purposes. It's crucial to consider the ethical implications of deploying machine learning models in sensitive domains such as fraud detection. Always adhere to legal and ethical guidelines when working with financial data.

Feel free to explore the project, and don't hesitate to reach out for any questions or clarifications.
